Can Wash Data Analytics Project

Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a Data Analytics bootcamp and focuses on the analysis and optimization of the business operations of Can Wash, a self-service laundromat company based in Ibiza. The primary goal is to evaluate the company's growth in sales and provide tools for better business control and decision-making.

Business Context

Can Wash currently operates three branches in Ibiza and is preparing to open a fourth branch in Formentera. The laundromats only accept euro coins (€0.5, €1, and €2), with coin exchange machines available on-site. Earnings are collected through regular rounds across branches, which are carried out four days a week.

Historically, sales were recorded informally through a WhatsApp group. A temporary system using Google Sheets was implemented to provide better tracking and basic analysis. However, this solution required further improvements to handle growth and expansion.

Project Goals

Analyze Sales Growth: Evaluate whether sales are genuinely increasing and identify trends and patterns across branches.

Optimize Business Processes: Create a system to streamline data collection, visualization, and reporting for better operational control.

Develop a Scalable Tool: Design a prototype application to facilitate sales data management and provide actionable insights.

Key Deliverables

Data Analysis:

Extraction, transformation, and analysis of sales data using Python.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns.

Visualizations:

Creation of interactive dashboards in Tableau to showcase sales insights.

Streamlit Application:

Features include:

Recording daily sales data by branch.

Filtering and searching historical sales records.

Modifying and updating records.

Visualizing sales trends and key metrics.

Database Design:

A conceptual Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) outlining a scalable database structure for future integration.

Technical Stack

Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit)

Data Visualization: Tableau

Database Design: MySQL (conceptual design only)

Tools: Google Sheets, Jupyter Notebook

Next Steps

Cost Analysis: Incorporate cost data to enable profitability analysis and more comprehensive decision-making.

Customer Registration: Develop an app for customer registrations, enabling personalized promotions and loyalty programs.

Database Implementation: Transition from conceptual design to a fully functional database integrated with the Streamlit application.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how data analytics and modern tools can enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights. By implementing the proposed solutions, Can Wash is well-positioned to sustain growth and scale effectively in the competitive laundromat industry.
